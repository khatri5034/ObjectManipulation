# 🎭 Sculpture List Lengths

## 📌 About This Project
This project processes a list of sculptures using Node.js. It extracts the lengths of the values in the dataset and creates a new object (`sculptureListLengths`) with those lengths.

## 📂 Files in This Repository
- `sculptureScript.js` - The main script that processes the data.
- `data.js` - Contains the original list of sculptures.
- `readme.md` - This documentation.

## 📊 Example Output
After running `node sculptureScript.js`, the first element of `sculptureListLengths` looks like this:

```javascript
{
  name: 24,
  artist: 20,
  description: 187,
  url: 28,
  alt: 87
}
